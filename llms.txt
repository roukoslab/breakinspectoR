# breakinspectoR

A companion R package to the BreakTag protocol for the identification of
CRISPR offtargets. breakinspectoR is an R package which performs a
guided search toward putative on-/off-targets.

### Initial preprocessing

Initial preprocessing is typically done in a linux cluster using the
[Breaktag pipeline](https://github.com/roukoslab/breaktag). It includes
the following steps:

1.  scanning for reads (single- or paired-end) containing the expected
    8-nt UMI followed by the 8-nt sample barcode in the 5’ end of read
    1.
2.  alignment of reads to reference genome with BWA, with a seed length
    of 19 and default scoring/penalty values for mismatches, gaps and
    read clipping.
3.  reads mapped with a minimum quality score Q (defaults to Q=60) are
    retained.
4.  close spatial consecutive reads within a window of 30 nucleotides
    and UMI differing with up to 2 mismatches are considered PCR
    duplicates and only one is kept.

The resulting reads are aggregated per position and reported as a BED
file.

### breakinspectoR analysis

The analysis path consists of the following steps:

1.  from the previously generated BED file, identify stacks of read ends
    as the candidate loci of being CRISPR-edited.
2.  obtain the sequence context of the candidate loci, and keep only
    those which are at most `N` nucleotides upstream from a PAM and
    contain up to M mismatches with regard to the gDNA guide sequence.
    Defaults are the canonical N=3, M=7, PAM=“NGG”.
3.  count number of reads (== signal or DSBreaks) in the targeted and
    the non-targeted control library.
4.  test if the enrichment of reads we see in the targeted library is
    significant compared to the non-targeted control library. Here
    breakinspectoR will perform a binomial test with the following
    criteria:
    1.  preconditions:
        1.  A = number of breaks within the region in the target library
        2.  B = total number of breaks in the whole target library
        3.  C = number of breaks within the region in the nontarget
            library
        4.  D = total number of breaks in the whole nontarget library
    2.  the binomial model for calculating the p-Value is:
        1.  number of trials = A+1
        2.  number of successes = B+1
        3.  estimated success probability in each trial = (C+1) / (D+1)
    3.  the enrichment is then calculated as: ((A+1) / (B+1)) / ((C+1) /
        (D+1))
    4.  note that we add a pseudocount to avoid dividing by 0
    5.  q-values and local False Discovery Rate values are estimated for
        FDR control.
5.  additionally, breakinspectoR implements a complimentary \[and
    elaborated\] method to estimate the false discovery of targets. To
    summarize, breakinspectoR reshuffles the signal in the target
    library using several multinomially distributed random number
    vectors sampled with equal probabilities to the signal in the
    originally detected offtargets. Then, breakinspectoR analysis is
    done in the reshuffled target library vs. the non-target library,
    and an FDR is estimated comparing the signal of each offtarget
    called in the original target library to the targets detected in the
    reshuffled target library (where no targets were expected to be
    called).
6.  breakinspectoR includes several handy visualizations to further
    analyze and summarize the on-/off-targets detected. Some of these
    functions include the analysis of fidelity of the gDNA, sequence
    composition of target regions, frequency of mismatches per position
    of the protospacer, or the genomic distribution of the targeted
    regions.

## Installation

Open R and install directly from Github with `devtools` (install the
package `devtools` if you haven’t, yet):

``` r
devtools::install_github("roukoslab/breakinspectoR")
```

## Example usage

This is a simple example using the demo data for human chr6 included
with the package. The experiment identifies offtargets generated by the
VEGFA site 2 sgRNA with CRISPR/Cas9.

Call the breakinspectoR analysis to find offtargets enriched in the
targeted library compared to the non-targeted. We’ll stick to the
default 7 mismatches allowed to the guide, with the expected cut site 3
bp away from the PAM (Cas9).

``` r
target_file     <- system.file("extdata/vegfa.chr6.bed.gz", package="breakinspectoR")
non_target_file <- system.file("extdata/nontarget.chr6.bed.gz", package="breakinspectoR")
guide           <- "GACCCCCTCCACCCCGCCTC"
PAM             <- c(canonical="NGG", "NAG")
bsgenome        <- "BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38"

offtargets <- breakinspectoR(
    target        =target_file,
    nontarget     =non_target_file,
    guide         =guide,
    PAM           =PAM,
    bsgenome      =bsgenome,
    cutsiteFromPAM=3,
    verbose       =FALSE
)
```

The analysis will take few seconds to run. Afterwards we have a
comprehensive table with few hundred enriched offtarget loci, which we
can summarize using the accompanying plotting functions:

``` r
plot_position_cutsite(offtargets, guide=guide, pam=PAM["canonical"])
plot_mismatch_freq(offtargets)
plot_offtargets_by_pam(offtargets)
plot_sequence_composition(offtargets, guide=guide, pam=PAM["canonical"])
plot_guide_fidelity(offtargets, guide=guide, pam=PAM["canonical"])
plot_genomic_position(offtargets, bsgenome=bsgenome,
                      target=system.file("extdata/vegfa.chr6.bed.gz", package="breakinspectoR"))
plot_pam_logo(offtargets)
plot_pam_composition(offtargets)
manhattan_plot(offtargets, bsgenome=bsgenome)

# simulate 2 different experiments by picking 25 random offtargets
spcas9 <- c(offtargets[offtargets$mismatches == 0], sample(offtargets, 25))
lz3    <- c(offtargets[offtargets$mismatches == 0], sample(offtargets, 25))
plot_relative_activity(list(SpCas9=spcas9, LZ3=lz3), what="all")
plot_specificity(list(SpCas9=spcas9, LZ3=lz3))
```

### Scission profile analysis

One unique feature of BreakTag is that it provides the structure of a
DSB at single base resolution. BreakinspectoR implements a method and
several visualizations to analyze DSB end structure as determined by
BreakTag.

``` r
offtargets.scission_profile <- scission_profile_analysis(
  x        =offtargets,
  target   =system.file("extdata/vegfa.chr6.bed.gz", package="breakinspectoR"),
  nontarget=system.file("extdata/nontarget.chr6.bed.gz", package="breakinspectoR"),
  bsgenome ="BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38")
```

Along with several useful visualizations:

``` r
# simulate 2 different experiments by picking 25 random offtargets
spcas9 <- sample(offtargets.scission_profile, 25)
lz3    <- sample(offtargets.scission_profile, 25)

plot_blunt_rate_density(list(SpCas9=spcas9, LZ3=lz3))
plot_overhang_size(list(SpCas9=spcas9, LZ3=lz3))
plot_scission_profile(offtargets.scission_profile)
```

## Input files

Input BED files describing coordinates and number of DSB are expected
for the “target” and “non-target” libraries. It’s possible to run
breakinspectoR without the non-target library, nevertheless it is
advised to include such experiment to calculate a p-value and control
the false discovery rate.

``` sh
chr6  148074  148075  .  2  +
chr6  148093  148094  .  1  -
chr6  148240  148241  .  1  -
chr6  148503  148504  .  1  +
chr6  148636  148637  .  1  -
chr6  148697  148698  .  1  -
chr6  149009  149010  .  1  -
chr6  149363  149364  .  1  +
chr6  150252  150253  .  2  +
chr6  150263  150264  .  1  +
```

These files are typically created with the [Breaktag
pipeline](https://github.com/roukoslab/breaktag), although any
conforming BED file is accepted in breakinspectoR.

## BTmotif

Additionally, you may want to run the companion shiny app to derive Cas9
sequence determinants from BreakInspectoR output.

It uses XGBoost and the provided sequence (usually, a protospacer) to
predict which nucleotides and positions are important to predict any
numerical outcome (eg. the blunt rate, Cas9 activity, etc.).

### Dependencies

The main dependency is [H2O](https://h2o.ai/), which can be installed
from CRAN. The app has been tested with H2O version 3.36.1.2.

``` r
install.packages("h2o", type="source", repos="http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-zumbo/2/R")
```

Test the H2O installation with:

``` r
library(h2o)
localH2O = h2o.init()
demo(h2o.kmeans)
```

You’ll need a couple of packages to run the web app:

``` r
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("shinydashboard")
```

To generate the motifs, you’ll also need `ggplot2` and `ggseqlogo`:

``` r
install.packages("ggplot2")
devtools::install_github("omarwagih/ggseqlogo")
```

### Run

Open the web app in your R console:

``` r
breakinspectoR::shiny_BTmotif()
```

Paste a table of targets and click on `Go!`. Or check the `Example`
data. The list can actually be a table with \<tab\> or \<comma\>
separated fields. The columns are expected to be in this order:
protospacer_sequence \| blunt_rate.

## bluntPred

For your set of gRNAs, you may want to run the prediction of blunt rates
of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) using the XGBoost model trained
with HiPlex1 data.

### Dependencies

The main dependency is [H2O](https://h2o.ai/).

Remove any previously installed H2O packages for R.

``` r
if ("package:h2o" %in% search()) { detach("package:h2o", unload=TRUE) }
if ("h2o" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) { remove.packages("h2o") }
```

Download packages that H2O depends on.

``` r
install.packages(c("RCurl","jsonlite", "devtools"))
```

Download and install the H2O package for R. The models were trained on
H2O version 3.36.1.2, therefore specifically install this version.

``` r
install.packages("h2o", type="source", repos="http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-zumbo/2/R")
```

Test the H2O installation with:

``` r
library(h2o)
localH2O = h2o.init()
demo(h2o.kmeans)
```

Now, it’s all set to install the package.

The package resides in GitHub only. You will probably need `devtools`
for that (`install.packages("devtools")`).

``` r
devtools::install_github("roukoslab/bluntPred")
```

### Run

Open the web app in your R console:

``` r
bluntPred::shiny_bluntPred()
```

Paste a list of gRNAs targets and click on `Predict`. The list can
actually be a table with \<tab\> or \<comma\> separated fields. The gRNA
sequence is expected to be in the *first* column.

NOTE: Only the seed portion of the protospacer (this is, the last 10
nucloetides of the target sequence) are used for the prediction in this
model.
